# **Project Name**    -The goal of this project is to understand which financial, behavioral, and demographic factors influence a customer’s credit score. Using the dataset provided, the project aims to identify relationships between income, credit utilization, delayed payments, number of loans, and overall credit health.

##  KEY INSIGHTS SUMMARY

1.  **Income & Debt**

    *   Higher-income customers do not always maintain lower debt.
    *   Debt distribution is wide → suggests diverse borrowing behaviour.

3.  **Delayed Payments**

    *   Majority of customers delay payments rarely (0–2 times),
    *   but a long tail of high-delay customers indicates riskier segments.

3.  **Age Behaviour**

    *   Middle-aged groups (30–50) carry higher debt on average.

4.  **Monthly Trends**

    *   EMI burden varies across months → light seasonality.
    *   Certain months show elevated repayment pressure.

BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS**

1.  **Target High-Utilization Users**

    Users with utilization > 60% should receive:

    *   notifications
    *   credit counseling
    *   repayment reminders
    *   spending control alerts

    They are the highest risk group.

3.  **Use Debt-Income Ratio as Core Risk Flag**

    Debt-to-Income > 0.5 should signal:

    *   top priority monitoring
    *   financial stress alerts
    *   customized repayment solutions

4.  **Improve Repayment Reminders During Peak Months**

    Months with higher EMI burden may require:

    *   early reminders
    *   flexible due-date nudges
    *   temporary relief options

5.  **Encourage Responsible Credit Card Behaviour**

    Customers with multiple cards but low delays show discipline.
    Reward these users with:

    *   lower interest
    *   higher limits
    *   loyalty points
  
  
  Conclusion:
  
The analysis shows that credit risk in this dataset is driven mainly by behavioural and financial stress indicators, not demographic variables.

Customers with high credit utilization, high debt-to-income ratio, and frequent delayed payments consistently display poorer credit behaviour. These three variables form the strongest pattern across the entire dataset.

Age, occupation and income do show some relationship with debt, but neither explains credit behaviour as strongly as utilization and payment discipline.

Seasonality exists but is mild—some months show elevated EMI burden, suggesting temporary financial pressure.

Overall, the dataset reveals clear, consistent financial patterns:

higher debt load → greater financial stress

This concludes that credit risk can be assessed effectively using utilization behaviour, payment history, and debt pressure indicators.
